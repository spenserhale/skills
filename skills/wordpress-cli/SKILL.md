# WordPress CLI

A skill for working with WP-CLI to manage WordPress installations from the terminal.

## When to use

Activate this skill when the user asks to:

- Run WordPress management commands (plugins, themes, users, options, database, content, cache, cron)
- Troubleshoot or inspect a WordPress site from the terminal
- Perform database exports, imports, or search-replace operations
- Manage WordPress core updates or maintenance mode

## Start with `wp help`

Before guessing at flags or subcommands, **use the built-in help system**. This is the single most important habit for working with WP-CLI accurately.

```bash
# Top-level overview of every available command
wp help

# Detailed help for a specific command (arguments, flags, examples)
wp help <command>

# Help for a subcommand
wp help <command> <subcommand>
```

**Examples:**

```bash
wp help plugin            # Shows install, activate, deactivate, update, list, etc.
wp help search-replace    # Shows positional args, --dry-run, --precise, table filters
wp help user create       # Shows exact syntax for creating a user
```

**Rule of thumb:** If you are unsure about the exact flags or syntax for any WP-CLI command, run `wp help <command>` first and read the output before constructing the actual command.

## Useful Global Flags

| Flag | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `--path=/path/to/wp` | Target a specific WordPress install |
| `--url=example.com` | Target a specific site in a multisite network |
| `--format=json` | Output as JSON (also: `csv`, `table`, `yaml`) |
| `--quiet` | Suppress informational messages |
| `--allow-root` | Run as root (useful inside Docker containers) |

---

## Command Pattern

All WP-CLI commands follow this structure:

```
wp <command> <subcommand> [positional-args] [--named-args] [--flags]
```

When in doubt, run `wp help <command>` to see exactly what's available.
